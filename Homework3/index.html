                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Emily Wang, a junior at Northeastern University studying Data Science and 
                    Business Administration with a concentration in Fintech. I'm passionate about using 
                    technology and data to solve real-world problems. Throughout my academic journey, 
                    I've had the opportunity to work with amazing companies like GitHub and Brown Brothers 
                    Harriman, where I've gained hands-on experience in software documentation, business 
                    analysis, and financial technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love exploring the intersection of technology and finance, and I'm always eager to 
                    learn new skills and take on exciting challenges. Whether it's analyzing data with 
                    Python, working on innovative Fintech projects, or collaborating with diverse teams, 
                    I'm driven by curiosity and a desire to make a positive impact. When I'm not studying 
                    or working, you can find me leading workshops as an Adobe Campus Ambassador or 
                    organizing networking events with industry professionals through Disrupt The FinTech 
                    Initiative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that technology has the power to transform industries and improve lives. 
                    My experiences have taught me the importance of clear communication, teamwork, and 
                    creative problem-solving. I'm excited about the future and all the opportunities 
                    ahead! Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my experiences, projects, 
                    and interests. Thank you for visiting, and I'd love to connect with you!
